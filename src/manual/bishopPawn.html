        <h1>Bishops against Pawns</h1>
        <p>Bishops against pawns is played in 5x5 chessboard, one player has
            two bishops and another has five pawns. In <strong>options</strong> 
            at <strong>Select Game</strong> dialog window you can define which
            player has bishops. If white player plays with bishops, white 
            bishops starts at "b1" and "c1" squares and black pawns starts at
            5th rank. Otherwise, white pawns starts at 1st rank and black

        <p>Bishop can move any number of squares in diagonal, 
            and captures in same way. Bishop can't jump another pieces.</p>

        <p>Pawn can move only one square in front. If another piece is in
            front of pawn, this pawn can't move. Pawn captures opponent piece
            at diagonal.</p>
        <p class="imageConfigure2">
            <img src="images/pawnMovement.png" alt="Pawn movement">
            <br>Pawn movement. Pawn at "a2" can't move, since bishop
            at "a3" blocks pawn movement. Pawn at "c2" can move to "c3" or
            capture bishop at "d3".
        </p>
        <p>Player with bishops must capture all opponent pawns or block all
            pawn movements to win. Player with pawns must carry at least one 
            pawn to last rank (5th rank if white pawns or 1st rank if black 
            pawns) and this pawn can't be captured in next opponent move.
            Player with pawns also win if all opponent bishops are captured.</p>
