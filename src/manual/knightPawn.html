        <p>Knight has special movement that describes 'L' character and is
            only piece that can jump another pieces. Knight captures a piece
            if this piece stays in last square of knight movement.</p>

        <p>Pawn can move only one square in front. If another piece is in
            front of pawn, this pawn can't move. Pawn captures opponent piece
            at diagonal.</p>
        <p class="imageConfigure2">
            <img src="images/pawnMovement2.png" alt="Pawn movement">
            <br>Pawn movement. Pawn at "a3" can't move, since knight
            at "a4" blocks pawn movement. Pawn at "b2" can move to "b3" or
            capture knight at "c3".
        </p>
        <p>Player with knights must capture all opponent pawns or block all
            pawn movements to win. Player with pawns must carry at least one 
            pawn to last rank (5th rank if white pawns or 1st rank if black 
            pawns) and this pawn can't be captured in next opponent move.
            Player with pawns also win if all opponent knights are captured.</p>
